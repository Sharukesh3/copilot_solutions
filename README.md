# Project Description

This project focuses on developing plugins that enhance prompt rewording and generate KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic AI, the plugins can create queries either from scratch or based on retrieved context. The goal is to streamline prompt engineering and automate query generation, improving productivity and accuracy for users working with data and AI-driven workflows.
